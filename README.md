# Microblog App (via Miguel Grinberg)

Ref: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/

Working repo of my version (slightly tweaked) of this app; goal = to learn Flask
and SQLAlchemy so I can properly contribute Flask projects.

Currently at: Part XVI Full-text Search

changelog:
- restructured, using blueprint

notes:
- haven't gotten email server working; some code in place for this, but work is
  pending
- also haven't tested request password reset (since dependent on email)
